## Hello, Bay Area!

I am a software engineer in Berkeley, CA, currently looking for my next opportunity.
At work, I solve problems with my logical brain and bring people together with
my emotional brain. At home, I make delicious food and beautiful music using my
creative brain and take care of my son and our cat with all my heart.

Most recently, I co-created <span>Conclave</span>, a collaborative peer-to-peer text editor
that runs in the browser. I think it's pretty cool. Check it out [here](https://conclave-app.herokuapp.com)!
<hr />

All my [projects](https://github.com/EliseJane), including Conclave are open source on Github.

You can read my [blog posts](https://medium.com/@EliseJane) on Medium.

You can view and download my [resume](https://elisejane.github.io/resume) here.
